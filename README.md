# Pesatbot
Telegram bot that answers every message containing a certain word. Simple as that.

It has been created using telebot (pyTelegramBotAPI), and it's currently hosted in Heroku.

# Trying Pesatbot
You can try Pesatbot at telegram.me/Pesatbot. Its taboo word is currently "pole". 
Examples:

![Normal conversation](http://i.imgur.com/jRosqq2.jpg "Normal conversation example")
![Group conversation](http://i.imgur.com/z6S4kc3.jpg "Group conversation example")

As you've seen, it also works in groups. Besides, it isn't case sensitive, and it even doesn't need _taboo_word_ to be isolated in the message

And that's all! Hope you enjoy chatting with @Pesatbot. And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
